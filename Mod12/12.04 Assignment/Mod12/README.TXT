PROJECT TITLE: Piecewise Functions
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Find value of a piecewise function for a variable
VERSION or DATE: 2/1/2017
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positves of this project is how fast the program can calculate the value of a long piecewise 
function with minimal lines of code. The negatives would be the inability for the user to enter in their
own piecewise function. I learned how to use recursion to effeciently calculate the value of a piecewise
function.
