PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To tell the user if his input is a palindrome
VERSION or DATE: February 7th, 2017
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the user friendly set up that is very forgiving. The negatives 
was the time it took to complete the program. I learned how to use recursion in string manipulation.
This program took time to write because of minor glitches. Not a misunderstanding of how to write a 
reursive program for strings.
