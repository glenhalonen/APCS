PROJECT TITLE: Fibonacci
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Calculate the nth Fibonacci number
VERSION or DATE: 02/04/2017
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The number of cows that Luke Edlebluth's brother washed was 13. The positives of this program is the 
interactiveness with the user in which the program does not crash and the user is able to make mistakes.
The negatives would be the fact that the user has to be prompted to enter e or not to continue or exit
the program. I learned how to use recursion to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
