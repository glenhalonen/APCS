PROJECT TITLE: Vehicle
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Take inventory of an array of objects
VERSION or DATE: 03/12/17
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    I learned how to use an interface combined with an abstract class to effectively create a heirarchy
of classes to create objects to be compared. I learned how to use List rather than ArrayList. The positives
is how quickly the program can compare different objects and take inventory of objects. The negatives would
be the user interactiveness.
