PROJECT TITLE: Hurricanes2
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Organize information from text file and new calculated arrays
VERSION or DATE: Sunday, November 13
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the user friendly report that is displayed in an orderly table. The negatives 
would be the actually usefulness of the program in which most will use it once and never look at it again. I learned
how to create an array through if statements and how to extract information from a file with multiple pieces of 
information.
