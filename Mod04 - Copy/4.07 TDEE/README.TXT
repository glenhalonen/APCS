PROJECT TITLE: TDEE
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Calculate TDEE
VERSION or DATE: Saturday, October 15
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the user friendly set up and a fast calculation for a spread of categories. The 
negatives would be the BMR in which the user is required to know if they want to get accurate results. I learned how
to use an if statement for more than one condtion.
