PROJECT TITLE: ArtWork
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Art with Strings
VERSION or DATE: 9/23/2016
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen
Learned: I learned how to use string literals to create print out pictures. That strings are useful for 
repeated statements but takes longer than using print statements. That \ must be used inside the quotes 
otherwise the system won't compile.
