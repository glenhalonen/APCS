PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Convert message to morse code.
VERSION or DATE:02/26/17
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the ability of the user to quickly convert a message to morse code. The
negatives are non existant as this program could potentially be useful. I learned how to call on static
methods of another class.
