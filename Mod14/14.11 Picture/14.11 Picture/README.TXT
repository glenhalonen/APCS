    I learned how to display the outline of an image in black and white by determinding the color difference
in Red, Green, and Blue. The positvies of this program is that it is interesting and can be useful for 
cases in which the color difference may be so small that the human eye coud not detect in which with this
program we could manipulate the specs so that we could determind the outline of an image.
