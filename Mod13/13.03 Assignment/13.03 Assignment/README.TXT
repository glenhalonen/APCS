PROJECT TITLE: TestPoly2
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Print out common information and the identification of each object
VERSION or DATE: 02/19/2017
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positive of this program is the ability to print out the center of each object to the screen
by reusing the same code. The negatives would be the strange letters that are returned by toString().
I learned how to efficiently print out information of the same type using polymorphism.
