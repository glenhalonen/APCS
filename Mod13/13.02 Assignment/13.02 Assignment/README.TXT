PROJECT TITLE: Terrain
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Find basic charactoristics of a terrain
VERSION or DATE: Saturday, February 18th
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the reuse of code to find charactoristics of a terrain. The negatives
would be the actual amount of work that the program accomplishes. I learned how to use hierarchies to 
reuse code.
