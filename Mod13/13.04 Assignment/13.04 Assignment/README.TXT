PROJECT TITLE: Rectangle
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Print result of each object to screen. See if any are equal.
VERSION or DATE: 02/19/2017
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the ability to overwrite a method for each particular object. The
negatives would be the amount of lines it takes to make a simple comparrison when using objects and 
ArrayList. I learned how to overwrite methods.
