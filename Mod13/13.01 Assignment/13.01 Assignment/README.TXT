PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use class hiarchy style to reuse code

AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the ability to reuse code. I found it suprising how little lines
it took to find sides when reusing code. The negatives would be having to keep track of the method call
which really is not that big of a deal. I learned how to use hierarches to reuse similar code.
