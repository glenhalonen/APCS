PROJECT TITLE: Candidate
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Delete candidates from a list.
VERSION or DATE: 3/25/17
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the ability to delete a candidate based of their name or their 
 placement in the list in which a table is printed with the results after editing the list. The negatives
 would be the fact that we lose information. I learned how to delete elements of an ArrayList and an array.
