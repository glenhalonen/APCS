PROJECT TITLE: WeightOnPlanetsV1
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Calculate weights on other planets.
VERSION or DATE: Wednesday, November 23
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is quick user-friendly feedback of a persons weight on a different 
planet. The negatives would be the fact that it isn't that interesting of a program. I learned how to 
use a method for a functional unit. Also the notes confused me so I decided to use my own formulas
which exp[lains why my numbers are slightly off.
