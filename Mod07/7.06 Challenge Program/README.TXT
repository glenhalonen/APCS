PROJECT TITLE: Darts
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Estimate pie.
VERSION or DATE: Wednesday, November 23
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen 

    The positives of this program is the interesting topic of where pie came from. Also the neat and 
orderly layout makes everything work easier. The negatives are virtually non existant, the user has the 
option of choosing the number of trials and the number of throws. I learned how to estimate pie and how 
to write functional units as a method.
