PROJECT TITLE: Circle Cordinates
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Calculate Cordinates on a Circle
VERSION or DATE: Saturday, November 19th
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the quick organized calculations that occur through java's math
classes. The negatives would be the fact that the program is not interactive. I learned how to use 
some of java's math classes.
