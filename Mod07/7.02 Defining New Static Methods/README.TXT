PROJECT TITLE: Converter
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Convert Between Units of Measure
VERSION or DATE: 11/21/2016
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positivesw of this program is how neat everything is laid out in which there are seperate methods
that get called on to do some work. These are accesible multiple times throughout the program avoiding 
the need to retype calculations. The negatives are almost non-existant. One could make a casse that were
typing too much but if we needed to perform the conversion more than once we are saving time. I learned
how to split the work up of the main method to other methods.
