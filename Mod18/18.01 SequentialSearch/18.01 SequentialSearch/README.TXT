PROJECT TITLE: Music
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Search for objects in  an array
VERSION or DATE:04/09/17
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the complete feedback is given when a search is undertaken. The negatives would
    be the fact that I feel like I have already done this before. I learned how to search an array for an object.
