PROJECT TITLE: Accepting User Input
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: So the user can input information
VERSION or DATE: 9/28/2016
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this code is very clear. A user can put infrmation into the computer and get feedback
about that information. For different numbers it is not required for one to have to go rewright their code. 
The negative would be the program fails with certain inputs so the programmer must effectively communicate
what shuld go in to the program. I learned how to write code so that one can make a quick input and get a 
quick resonse
