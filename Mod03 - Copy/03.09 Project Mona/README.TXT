PROJECT TITLE:Mona
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:Book fines
VERSION or DATE:01/10/2016
AUTHORS:Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is an email message that is formatted in a certain way in which the
user only has to enter information that will be used rather than wasting time retyping a bunch of
messages. The negatives is that their is not much room for custimization. I learned how to import 
the scanner and use it effectively. I also learned how to make a string become a numeric value.
