PROJECT TITLE:CurrencyConverterV1
VERSION or DATE:09/24/16:
AUTHORS:Glen Halonen

    The positives of using a converter is the simplicity of the code itself. The numbers mean less when  
 they are used without a meaningful variable. Takes a little bit more time to us the variables for the 
 calculations. I learned how to use variables in calculations.
