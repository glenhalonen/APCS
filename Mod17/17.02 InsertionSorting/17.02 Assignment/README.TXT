PROJECT TITLE: Movie2
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To sort an array.
VERSION or DATE: 02/04/17
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the ability to sort an array in either ascending or descending order.
 The negatives would be the number of repeat lines in which I feel there could be a better way to write
 this program. I learned how to sort a list of data.
