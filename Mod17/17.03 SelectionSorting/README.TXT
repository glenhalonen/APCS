PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To sort an array.

    The positives of this program is the ability to order an array of objects in either ascending or 
descending order. The negatives would be the fact that there are many lines that are being repeated. I
learned how to sort an array by finding the biggest value and placing it on either end of the array than
ignoring it.
