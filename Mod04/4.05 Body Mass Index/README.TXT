PROJECT TITLE: BMI
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Categorize Weights Based on BMI
VERSION or DATE: 10/8/16
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    Positive aspects about this program is the user can get a quick categorization of people's overall health. The 
negatives is that it is a broad generalization that is not always correct. Some may have a large BMI but it does not
reflect their health (ex. a football player). I learned how to effectively use else if statements when multiple decisions 
can be made.
