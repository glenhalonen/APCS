PROJECT TITLE: BMR
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Calculate calories per day
VERSION or DATE: Saturday, October 8th
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this project is the ability of the computer to use personal information and create personalized    
responses. The negatives are the limited number of decisions the computer makes. I learned how to utilize booleans and
if statements.
