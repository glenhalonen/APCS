PROJECT TITLE: myCO2Production
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To compute my CO2 consumption
VERSION or DATE: Jan 5, 2017
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the ability to add more people and the amount of information that 
the program can take. The negatives would be the fact that the program is uninteractive. I learned how to
effectively use methods of ArrayList.

         
    myCO2Production
    
    <<Instance Variables>>
    double myGallonsUsed
    double gasPoundsCO2
    double avgBill
    double avgPrice
    double elecPoundsCO2
    double elecReduction
    double netElecPounds
    double wasteEmissions
    double wasteReduction
    double netWasteEmissions
    double totalCO2
    int lightbulbs
    int numPeople
    boolean myPaper
    boolean myPlastic 
    boolean myGlass
    boolean myCans
    
     <<Constructor>>
    myCO2Production()
    
      <<Methods>>
    void calcGasPounds()
    void calcElecPounds()
    void calcElecReduction()
    void calcNetElecPounds()
    void calcGrossWasteEmission()
    void calcWasteReduction()
    void calcNetWaste()
    void calcTotalCO2()
    double getGasPounds()
    double getElecPounds()
    double getElecReduction()
    double getWasteReduction()
    double getNetEmissions()
    double getWasteEmissions()
    double getTotalCO2()




Pseudocode:
Create two classes
Create a constructor with multiple data types
Use ArrayList to create an array of objects.
pass in data to create people objects
crunch numbers with multiple mutator methods
print results to screen with getter methods
