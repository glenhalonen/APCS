PROJECT TITLE: CO2FromElectricityTester
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Calculate yearly CO2 emissions
VERSION or DATE: Monday, Jan 2nd
AUTHOR: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the ability to add an element to an array with one line of code. The 
negatives would be entering a new line for each number. I learned how to use methods in ArrayList.

         CO2FromElectricity
         
         <<Instance Variables>>
         double billSum
         double avgBill
         double priceSum
         double avgPrive
         double electricityCO2
          
           <<Constuctor>>   
         CO2FromElectricity()
         
             <<Methods>>
        double calcAverageBill()
        double calcAveragePrice()
        double calcElectricityCO2()
