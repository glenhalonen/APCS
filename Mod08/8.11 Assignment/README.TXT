PROJECT TITLE: CO2FromWasteTester
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Calculate CO2 from household
VERSION or DATE: Jan 2, 2017
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the abitlity to neatly print unlimited number of situations to the 
screen with minimal lies of code. The negatives would be entering in different households. I learned how
to utilize records for printing purposes and how to use Array List.
