PROJECT TITLE: CarV7
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Calculate mpg related data for multiple types of vehicles
VERSION or DATE: Sunday, December 11th
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the reusability of the methods that were written once as an object
saving a lot of time. The negatives would be the repetition in which I feel that a method should be 
used that would stop the repitition. I learned how to use a seperate class to use the methods of
another class.
