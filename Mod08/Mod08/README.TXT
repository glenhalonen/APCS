PROJECT TITLE: Catapult
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To calculate the distance a projectile will travel.
VERSION or DATE: Tuesday, January 17th
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the neat and orderly display of the calculated distances based on many 
different situations. The negative would be the interativeness with it's user. I learned how to manipulate
a 2d array.
