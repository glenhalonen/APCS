PROJECT TITLE: CO2FootprintV1 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Calculate CO2 emissins released from car.
VERSION or DATE: Jan 2, 2017
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the documentation inwhich it is very clear as to what is happening in
 the program. The negatives would be wasting lines on documenting getter methods. I learned how to 
 document methods, objects, and classes.
