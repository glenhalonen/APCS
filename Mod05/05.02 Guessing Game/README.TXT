PROJECT TITLE: Guessing Game
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Try to guess the number
VERSION or DATE: Sunday, October 23
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is simplicity. The negatives are the number of options. I learned how to compare 
a user imputed number to a randomly assigned number.
