PROJECT TITLE: Random password generator
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Genrate random passwords
VERSION or DATE: Sunday, October 30
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the amount of options that the user has in order to generate a ranndom password
of their choosing and the length of the password. The negatives would be the fact that the passwords would only be 
useful if one were to write it down. It would be nice if their was a secure way to store passwords. I learned how 
useful nested loops can be.
