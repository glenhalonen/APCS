PROJECT TITLE: Eleven Sided Dice
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Find probability of a sum when rolling an eleven-sided dice.
VERSION or DATE: Sunday, October 30
AUTHORS:Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the chance out of 100 there is for a single role. The negatives would be the choice
of the number of sides to the die. I learned how to use for loops to role dice and to print an array on the screen.
