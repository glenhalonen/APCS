PROJECT TITLE: Bottle Cap Winner
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: See what the average amount of bottles it takes for there to be a winner
VERSION or DATE: Sunday, October 30
AUTHORS:Glen Halonen

    The positives about this program is the ability to truely simulate how many times on average it will take one to 
pick the right bottle. The negatives would be the option for a user to pick the ratio. I learned how to print to a 
a new file.
