PROJECT TITLE: Population Ratio
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To generate a predicted population
VERSION or DATE:Sunday, October 23
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the user friendliness in which the user can get a prediction for the sex ratio 
 of the population. The negatives would be the limit of only being able to generate info for one country. I learned
 how to use the random number method to output info through a ratio.
