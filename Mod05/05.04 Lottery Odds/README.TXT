PROJECT TITLE: Lottery
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Make a guess, see if you win.
VERSION or DATE: 10/25/2016
AUTHORS: Glen Halonen

    The positives of this program is the computer is able to generate a random three digit number, and 
the user is able to compare their number to the computers. The negative would be the fact that you have to
rerun the program for every entry. I learned how to use the for loop to create a string.
